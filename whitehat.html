                <p class="fst-italic">These sobering figures illustrate why there's such a desperate need for White Hat hackers. More users mean more mobile usage, more networks, and more websites. E of these elements needs to be tested thoroughly, run through their paces to make sure that cyber-criminal hackers can't penetrate their defenses. More testers are required to address this shortage.</p>
