            <h2>Web Attacks</h2>


            <p><strong>Web application attacks are the single most prevalent and devastating security threat facing organizations today. Attacks such as SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) are responsible for some of the largest security breaches in history, including the top three credit card breaches between 2005 and 2010. At one retailer, hackers used SQL injection to compromise servers and steal 45 million records, costing the organization an estimated $256 million.</strong>
            </p>


            <p><strong>Web attacks are growing in number, with 100% of organizations in a broad survey reporting that they had recently suffered a web attack.The same survey found that Web attacks are also the most detrimental type of attack; they cost organizations over 100 times more than malware and 50 times more than viruses, worms and trojans annually</strong>

                <h3>Web Attacks Are Targeted</h3>


                <p class="fst-italic">Web applications are easily accessible to hackers. They are also a lucrative attack target because they often store valuable data such as credit card numbers, personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data.</p>


                <h3>Web Attacks Are Often Successful</h3>


                <p class="fst-italic">Most Web applications - over 80% - have had high, critical, or urgent vulnerabilities.This is due in part to the lack of effort applied to secure coding; most developers are motivated to write code quickly or create new functionality rather than to develop secure applications.</p>


                <h3>Web Attacks Are Becoming More Advanced</h3>


                <p class="fst-italic">Sophisticated attack techniques have enabled hackers to launch large-scale attacks more quickly. Hackers have also become more organized, building criminal networks and sharing exploits in underground forums. New automated attack tools now leverage search engines to rapidly discover and attack tens of thousands of sites. For even greater efficiency and scale, hackers have built networks of bots - remotely controlled computers - to unleash large-scale attacks.8 Because Web attacks have become so effective, regulations such as PCI DSS now mandate Web application security.</p>


                <h3>Traditional Network Security Solutions Cannot Stop Web Attacks</h3>


                <p class="fst-italic">Firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) are essential for preventing network attacks. "Next generation" firewalls go one step further by adding application awareness, which compares traffic against fingerprints of known applications. Unfortunately, none of these products understand acceptable Web user behavior, such as Web form field input length and allowed characters. Without this application understanding, or white list, network security products cannot accurately detect application attacks like SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and parameter tampering. In addition, they do not monitor application sessions, so they can't stop cookie poisoning, cookie injection, or session replay attacks. Hackers can also evade network security products using encoding and other Web based evasion techniques. And most network security products cannot decrypt HTTPS (SSL) traffic.</p>


                <h3>Manual Vulnerability Mitigation Can Be Costly and Expose Applications</h3>


                <p class="fst-italic">One approach to thwarting Web attacks is to follow secure coding best practices and fix outstanding application vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, manually fixing vulnerabilities, particularly in production, can be costly and time consuming. Fixing one vulnerability in production costs $12,000 on average9 and takes 2 to 4 months,10 putting applications at risk for long periods of time. While every organization should always follow secure application coding best practices, relying on manual coding and fix processes alone can be costly and expose applications to compromise.</p>

                <h3>Web Application Firewalls: Purpose Built to Stop Web Attacks</h3>


                <p class="fst-italic">Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are specifically designed to prevent the biggest threat for every organization with a Web presence today: Web attacks. WAFs combine several security measures together to offer accurate protection against a myriad of threats, including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, Web site scraping, reconnaissance, application Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and many more.</p>
