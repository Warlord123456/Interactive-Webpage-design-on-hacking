        <h1>Zero Day Attack</h1>


        <h2>"Zero-day" is a broad term that describes recently discovered security vulnerabilities that hackers can use to attack systems. The term "zero-day" refers to the fact that the vendor or developer has only just learned of the flaw - which means they have "zero days" to fix it. A zero-day attack takes place when hackers exploit the flaw before developers have a chance to address it.</h2>

            <p>Zero-day is sometimes written as 0-day. The words vulnerability, exploit, and attack are typically used alongside zero-day, and it's helpful to understand the difference:</p>


            <ul style="margin-left: +2em">
              <li>A zero-day vulnerability is a software vulnerability discovered by attackers before the vendor has become aware of it. Because the vendors are unaware, no patch exists for zero-day vulnerabilities, making attacks likely to succeed.</li>


              <li>A zero-day exploitis the method hackers use to attack systems with a previously unidentified vulnerability.</li>


              <li>A zero-day attack is the use of a zero-day exploit to cause damage to or steal data from a system affected by a vulnerability.</li>

                <ul style="margin-left: +2em;">
                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>Stuxnet:</strong>This malicious computer worm targeted computers used for manufacturing purposes in several countries, including Iran, India, and Indonesia. The primary target was Iran's uranium enrichment plants, with the intention of disrupting the country's nuclear program.The zero-day vulnerabilities existed in software running on industrial computers known as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which ran on Microsoft Windows. The worm infected the PLCs through vulnerabilities in Siemens Step7 software, causing the PLCs to carry out unexpected commands on assembly line machinery, sabotaging the centrifuges used to separate nuclear material.</li>


                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>Sony zero-day attack:</strong> Sony Pictures was the victim of a zero-day exploit in late 2014. The attack crippled Sony's network and led to the release of sensitive corporate data on file-sharing sites. The compromised data included details of forthcoming movies, business plans, and the personal email addresses of senior Sony executives. The details of the exact vulnerability exploited in the Sony attack remains unknown.</li>


                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>RSA:</strong>In 2011, hackers used a then-unpatched vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player to gain access to the network of security company RSA. The attackers sent emails with Excel spreadsheet attachments to small groups of RSA employees. The spreadsheets contained an embedded Flash file that exploited the zero-day Flash vulnerability. When one of the employees opened the spreadsheet, the attacked installed the Poison Ivy remote administration tool to take control of the computer.Once they gained access to the network, attackers searched for sensitive information, copied it and transmitted it to external servers they controlled. RSA admitted that among the data stolen was sensitive information related to the company's SecurID two-factor authentication products, used around the world for access to sensitive data and devices.</li>


                  <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> <strong>Operation Aurora:</strong> This 2009 zero-day exploit targeted the intellectual property of several major enterprises, including Google, Adobe Systems, Yahoo, and Dow Chemical. The vulnerabilities existed in both Internet Explorer and Perforce; the latter was used by Google to manage its source code.</li>
