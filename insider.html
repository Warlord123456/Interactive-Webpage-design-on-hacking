            <h2>Insider Threat</h2>


            <p><strong>An insider threat refers to a cyber security risk that originates from within an organization. It typically occurs when a current or former employee, contractor, vendor or partner with legitimate user credentials misuses their access to the detriment of the organization's networks, systems and data. An insider threat may be executed intentionally or unintentionally. No matter the intent, the end result is compromised confidentiality, availability, and/or integrity of enterprise systems and data.</strong>
            </p>


            <p><strong>Insider threats are the cause of most data breaches. Traditional cybersecurity strategies, policies, procedures and systems often focus on external threats, leaving the organization vulnerable to attacks from within. Because the insider already has valid authorization to data and systems, it's difficult for security professionals and applications to distinguish between normal and harmful activity.</strong>
            </p>


            <p><strong>Malicious insiders have a distinct advantage over other categories of malicious attackers because of their familiarity with enterprise systems, processes, procedures, policies and users. They are keenly aware of system versions and the vulnerabilities therein. Organizations must therefore tackle insider threats with at least as much rigor as they do external threats.</strong>

              </li>


              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p style="margin-left:+1.5em">Also referred to as a turncloak, the principal goals of malicious insider threats include espionage, fraud, intellectual property theft and sabotage. They intentionally abuse their privileged access to steal information or degrade systems for financial, personal and/or malicious reasons. Examples include an employee who sells confidential data to a competitor or a disgruntled former contractor who introduces debilitating malware on the organization's network.</p>


                <p style="margin-left:+1.5em"><strong>Malicious insider threats may be collaborators or lone wolves.</strong>
                </p>
              </li>


              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line" style="margin-left:+2.5em"></i><strong>Collaborator</strong>
              </li>


              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p style="margin-left:+3.5em">Collaborators are authorized users who work with a third party to intentionally harm the organization. The third party may be a competitor, nation-state, organized criminal network or an individual. The collaborator's action would lead to the leak of confidential information or the disruption of business operations.</p>
              </li>


              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line" style="margin-left:+2.5em"></i><strong>Lone Wolf</strong>
              </li>


              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p style="margin-left:+3.5em">Lone wolves operate entirely independently and act without external manipulation or influence. They can be especially dangerous because they often have privileged system access such as database administrators.</p>
              </li>


              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i><strong>Careless Insider Threats</strong>
              </li>


              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p style="margin-left:+1.5em">Careless insider security threats occur inadvertently. They are often the result of human error, poor judgement, unintentional aiding and abetting, convenience, phishing (and other social engineering tactics), malware and stolen credentials. The individual involved unknowingly exposes enterprise systems to external attack.</p>


                <p style="margin-left:+1.5em"><strong>Careless insider threats may be pawns or goofs.</strong>
                </p>

              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line" style="margin-left:+2.5em"></i><strong>Pawn</strong>

              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p style="margin-left:+3.5em">Pawns are authorized users who have been manipulated into unintentionally acting maliciously, often through social engineering techniques such as spear phishing. These unintentional acts could include downloading malware to their computer or disclosing confidential information to an impostor.</p>
              </li>


              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line" style="margin-left:+2.5em"></i><strong>Goof</strong>
              </li>


              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p style="margin-left:+3.5em">Goofs deliberately take potentially harmful actions but harbor no malicious intent. They are arrogant, ignorant and/or incompetent users who do not recognize the need to follow security policies and procedures. A goof may be a user who stores confidential customer information on their personal device, even though they know it's against organizational policy.</p>
              </li>


              <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i><strong>A Mole</strong>
              </li>


              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                <p style="margin-left:+3em">A mole is an outsider but one who has gained insider access to the organization's systems. They may pose as a vendor, partner, contractor or employee, thereby obtaining privileged authorization they otherwise would not qualify for.</p>

              <h3>How to Detect an Insider Threat</h3>


              <p class="fst-italic">Most threat intelligence tools focus on the analysis of network, computer and application data while giving scant attention to the actions of authorized persons who could misuse their privileged access. For secure cyber defense against an insider threat, you have to keep an eye on anomalous behavioral and digital activity.</p>


              <p><strong>Behavioral Indicators</strong>
              </p>


              <p><strong>There are a few different indicators of an insider threat that should be looked out for, including:</strong>
              </p>


              <ul style="margin-left: +0.5em;">
                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i><strong>A dissatisfied or disgruntled employee, contractor, vendor or partner.</strong>
                </li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Attempts to circumvent security.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Regularly working off-hours.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Displays resentment toward co-workers.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Routine violation of organizational policies</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Contemplating resignation or discussing new opportunities.</li>
              </ul>


              <p><strong>Digital Indicators</strong>
              </p>


              <ul style="margin-left: +0.5em;">
                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Signing into enterprise applications and networks at unusual times. For instance, an employee who, without prompting, signs into the network at 3am may be cause for concern.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Surge in volume of network traffic. If someone is trying to copy large quantities of data across the network, you will see unusual spikes in network traffic.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Accessing resources that they usually don't or that they are not permitted to.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Accessing data that is not relevant for their job function.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Repeated requests for access to system resources not relevant for their job function.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>Using unauthorized devices such as USB drives.</li>

              <h3>Examples of Insider Threats</h3>


              <p class="fst-italic">Numerous insider cyberattacks take place each year, but the overwhelming majority do not make it to the news. There have, however, been insider threats in cyber security that have stood out in recent years.</p>


              <ul style="margin-left: +0.5em;">
                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>In 2018, <strong>Facebook fired a security engineer</strong> accused of exploiting the privileged information his position accorded him to stalk women online.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>In 2018, <strong>a Tesla employee</strong> was alleged to have sabotaged company systems and sent proprietary information to third parties.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>In the 2019 <strong>Capital One data breach</strong>, a former Amazon engineer retrieved more than 100 million customer records. They exploited their inside knowledge Amazon EC2 to circumvent a misconfigured firewall in Capital One's cloud server.</li>


                <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i>In 2020, <strong>a former Google executive was sentenced to 18 months in prison</strong> for stealing trade secrets from Google's self-driving-car division and handed them over to Uber, his new employer.</li>
