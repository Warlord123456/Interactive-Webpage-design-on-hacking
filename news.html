                <h3>UGC Hacked</h3>


                <p>The Twitter account of the University Grant Commission was hacked late Saturday night. The account has now been restored. After hacking the UGC Twitter account, several tweets related to NFT's were made from the account. The UGC Twitter handle has over 2,96,000 followers and is linked to the official website. This is the third government institution to be hacked in the past two days. Earlier, the Twitter accounts of the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's Office and the Indian Meteorological Department of India were similarly hacked. Meanwhile, a case has been registered in this regard against unknown persons under relevant sections of the IT Act at the cyber police station in Lucknow. The matter will be probed by a team of experts from the DGP office. The UP government said the strictest action will be taken against those responsible. The case is being investigated by cyber experts.</p>

                <h3>Chinese Hackers Targeted India</h3>


                <p>Cyber attackers linked to the Chinese military likely broke into the networks of seven power grid hubs in north India, an American cybersecurity research group said on Thursday, with at least some of the targeting being confirmed by a minister who said the attempts were not successful. The incident is the latest in a string of cyber espionage attributed to groups based in China, with past attacks targeting critical infrastructure such as power plants, and private organisations in sensitive sectors like defence and finance. "Two attempts by Chinese hackers were made to target electricity distribution centres near Ladakh but were not successful... We've already strengthened our defence system to counter such cyber attacks," RK Singh, Union minister for Power and new and renewable energy, said to news agency ANI. Hours earlier, US based cyber threat intelligence company Recorded Future released a report saying it had found evidence that "at least seven Indian state load dispatch centres (SLDCs)" and an Indian subsidiary of a multinational logistics company were targeted by a China-linked group that it has codenamed TAG-38. This is the third such attempt reported in a little over a year. In March, 2021, Recorded Future released findings of another China-linked cyber espionage campaign that targeted the Indian power grid, attributing the campaign to a group that it calls RedEcho. Later in June, Recorded Future identified RedFoxtrot, a second China-linked, as having targeted Indian telecom companies, government agencies and defence contractors.</p>
